\Data1

The unpolarized SIDIS cross-section pseudodata generated for 1902.10663. No detector effects!


\Data2

The same pseudo-data as in Data1 but with different binning. No detector effects!

\Data3

>at 18x275 GeV^2, including the acceptance cuts, as we discussed.
These cuts were: momentum>0.5 GeV and rapidity between -4 and 4.
When applying the DIS cuts Q^2>1 GeV^2; 0.01<y<0.95 and W^2>10 GeV^2, all
scattered leptons automatically satisfy the acceptance cuts.

(combined)= the combination of the 18x275 data and the 20x250 data  boosted to 18x275

also there is 5 x 50 data

\Data4

Ralf's unpolarized xSec for various energies, and various acceptance options. 
>The first several columns give you the bin's central values in the 4
kinematic variables and the last three are xsec, expected uncertainties
for 10 fb-1 and the estimate of the systematics by giving the
differences of the perfect and smeared/acceptance xsecs.
Contains various options for PID _opt1 -- _opt6 (opt5 is prefered, opt6 is maximum PID)
Contains also handbook realisation of detector _HB

\Data4_parsed

The Data4 parsed to artemide DataProcessor format

\Data4_cut

The Data4_parsed after the application of TMD cut (pT<0.25 zQ, Q>2, z>0.05) in artemide DataProcessor format
