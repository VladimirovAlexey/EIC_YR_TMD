\Data1

The unpolarized SIDIS cross-section pseudodata generated for 1902.10663. No detector effects!


\Data2

The same pseudo-data as in Data1 but with different binning. No detector effects!

\Data3

>at 18x275 GeV^2, including the acceptance cuts, as we discussed.
These cuts were: momentum>0.5 GeV and rapidity between -4 and 4.
When applying the DIS cuts Q^2>1 GeV^2; 0.01<y<0.95 and W^2>10 GeV^2, all
scattered leptons automatically satisfy the acceptance cuts.

(combined)= the combination of the 18x275 data and the 20x250 data  boosted to 18x275
