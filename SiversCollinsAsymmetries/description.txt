Description of files in the directory:

\Data1

Ralf's Sivers and Collins asymetries for various energies, and various acceptance options. 
>The first several columns give you the bin's central values in the 4
kinematic variables and the last three are xsec, expected uncertainties
for 10 fb-1 and the estimate of the systematics by giving the
differences of the perfect and smeared/acceptance xsecs.
Contains various options for PID _opt1 -- _opt6 (opt5 is prefered, opt6 is maximum PID)
Contains also handbook realisation of detector _HB

\Data2

Same as Data1 but for options opt6 and opt8 (specification needed!) Also opt5 for various reactions.

The following binning is used:
x: 12 x  bins, 3 per decade from 10-4 to 1
Q2:{1.,3.162,10.,31.62,100.,316.2,1000.,3162.,10000.}
pt:{0.,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9,1.2,1.5,1.8,2.4,4.0}
z:{0.,0.05,0.1,0.15,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0}

\Data1_parsed

The Data1 parsed to artemide DataProcessor format

\Data1_cut

The Data1_parsed after the application of TMD cut (pT<0.3 zQ, Q>2, z>0.05) in artemide DataProcessor format


\ECCE 

Ralf's Sivers and Collins asymetries for various energies, using ECCE setup. 
>All pseudo-data was again scaled to 10 fb-1 with a 70% proton beam polarization included in the
statistical uncertainties. A global 3% uncertainty due to the beam polarization measurement is not included.
